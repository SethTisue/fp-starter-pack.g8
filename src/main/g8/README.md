# Scala Finch Boilerplate

A solid foundation to start a finch/fingle app using circe

## Libraries

typesafe-config : A really nice config handler

scalacheck: Property-based testing for Scala

shapeless-scalacheck: nice helpers for scalacheck

logback: everyones favorite logger

joda: everyones favorite datatime methods

finch-core: the main finch classes

finch-circe: the best json de/serializer (well argonaut and rapture-json are fairly good as well :)

scapegoat, scaliform, etc: clean code is good code
