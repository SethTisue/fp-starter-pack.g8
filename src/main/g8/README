# Scala Finch Boilerplate

A solid foundation to start a finch/fingle app using circe

## Libraries

logback: everyones favorite logger

joda: everyones favorite datatime methods

finch-core: the main finch classes

finch-circe: the best json de/serializer (well argonaut and rapture-json are fairly good as well :)

scalaz: all my favorite monads and sigels

scala-blitz: some really amazing collection improvements

scapegoat, scaliform, etc: clean code is good code
