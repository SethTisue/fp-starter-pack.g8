# g8's project template for a typical finch stack

Wanted to make use g8 templates and make the whole use of the finch ecosystem easier to install. Also I wanted to make sure people working with finch got all the goodies.

## Requirements

You need to install [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8)

after which you only need to:

```
g8 bneil/finch-skeleton.g8
```

or thanks to the latest improvements to sbt you can use:

`sbt -sbt-version 0.13.15 new bneil/finch-skeleton.g8`

## Why Use Finch?

Because the reader monad is pretty sweet and trying out this whole server as a function is a neat application
